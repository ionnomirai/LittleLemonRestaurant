# LittleLemonRestaurant
**LittleLemonRestaurant** - is my capstone project for the 'Meta Android Developer' professional certificate from Meta.

## Project description
**LittleLemonRestaurant** - is a mobile app for Android designed for a small restaurant. The application is non-commercial. The application allows users to interact with the restaurant via the mobile app in real-time.

The purpose of this application is to allow customers of the restaurant to view the menu and, if desired, place an order for dishes without having to visit the restaurant in person. This significantly saves our customers' time, allowing them to use it more freely. Additionally, the ability to choose dishes in a comfortable environment and at any time allows customers to leisurely and thoroughly review each dish and select what they desire, without any rush or pressure.

The application pulls information from servers where course materials are hosted.
